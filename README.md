## teh r4v10l1 script   
I came back from 10 months of not programming but I am still working on it so I'm not going to decorate the readme too much :p
### Description
Teh r4v10l1 script is a script similar to lscript (https://github.com/arismelachroinos/lscript) made in bash for script kiddies or people who want to understand how the code is made.
The .tar.xz file has almost all the changes and different versions.

``` git clone https://github.com/r4v10l1/tehR4V10L1script``` 

``` cd tehR4V10L1script``` 

``` chmod +x tehR4V10L1script.sh```
